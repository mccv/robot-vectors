# Overview

Simple web app that shows a robot with a mounted camera along with a target april tag.
You can move the robot around, move the camera within the robot, and look at vectors from the
various objects to the april tag.

The intent is to get measurements in the various frames of reference to match up with calculations
in robot code, particularly for writing unit tests.
